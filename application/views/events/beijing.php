        <h1>BEIJING 2012</h1>
        <p>Giorgio Armani said, “I’ve always had a very special relationship with China, a country with a rich cultural background and a sophisticated aesthetic which has often inspired me in my search for atmosphere and mood. It is a place to which I have paid homage in many of my collections. I believe I can say I was one of the first to recognise the potential of the Chinese market: we opened our first boutique in Beijing in 1998, well ahead of the economic boom that has led the luxury sector to become interested in the region.</p>
        
        <p>More than a decade after my arrival in China, it seems to me that the time has come to celebrate our presence in the country and to present the current collections in a special way, edited just for this purpose. I didn’t want the celebration to be an end in itself, though; my trip will also offer an opportunity to present the research programme I have developed with Tsinghua University: an initiative I hold very dear, building another bridge between East and West, through the successful exchange of culture and know-how, supporting the new talent the region has to offer.”</p>
